I've made a small app which uses the countries api to bring up data regarding all the countries in the world. You can search by country and language spoken as well as being given a list of all available countries on the homescreen. 

I've focused on certain types of navigation, such as tabs, drawer and stack to make the app navigation seamless. 

I've also focused on search features and improving their calls to the api by using the debounce method.
